# FrankenTechnics Turntable Controller

A microcontroller-based motor controller retrofit for a vintage Technics SL-D2 turntable ‚Äî part reverse engineering, part resurrection, all DIY.

# üõ† What is this?
This Arduino-based script replaces the original proprietary motor controller (AN630U) in a Technics SL-D2 turntable with a modern, open-source alternative using the SimpleFOC motor control 
library. It controls a 3-phase BLDC motor for precise platter rotation at 33‚Öì or 45 RPM using closed-loop control with hall effect sensors, a SimpleFOC-compatible driver, and an 
Arduino-compatible microcontroller. It should thoretically work with any direct drive technics system with only slight modification.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Software Features
Closed-loop FOC motor control via SimpleFOC

RPM selection based on potentiometer input (mapped to 33‚Öì or 45 RPM with fine adjustment)

Strobe light synced to 60Hz visual timing marks on platter

Optional debug serial output showing raw sensor data and current speed

Configurable control constants for motion tuning

## Hardware
Microcontroller: Arduino R4 minima (or any arduino compatible MCU with atleast 85000 bytes of progmem).

Motor Driver: SimpleFOCmini or compatible BLDC driver

Motor: Original Technics 3-phase BLDC motor

Sensors: 3x Hall effect sensors for closed-loop feedback

Power Supply: Custom linear-regulated dual-voltage supply (5V + 30V)

Speed Selector: Original switch reused; analog-read mapped to RPM control
